The onset of Autumn is marked by festivals in India. Autumn's

- a time to break out for a while and rejuvenate oneself, return refreshed to the inevitable hustle-bustle of life
- a time to destress, celebrate small wins, and revitalize to keep moving onward and upward.

I too took a break and visited the Himalayas during the autumn of 2023. The thought of being relentlessly on-the-go bogs us down, most often we do not even realize it. At times, all it takes to be consistent is to not move ahead of ourselves, to just slow down and appreciate how far we have come and be grateful for everything around us. A pause and introspection is of paramount importance. Maybe in some ways it enables foreseeing the possibilities in store for us.

After coming back from my short vacation, during the winter of 2024 I decided to start blogging. My blog posts are about *Data Science and stuff*, and everything I feel like writing. I'm migrating my Substack posts since (Jan-2024) to GitHub pages, it is work-in-progress.

There are things we realize only when we slow down. Almost all of us have clear understanding of a few things and clouded, not-so-clear concepts of many other things. Real contentment and joy comes from sharing your knowledge and learning with others and learn back from them. Contributing to the community has two-way benefits, it's useful to more than just myself.
