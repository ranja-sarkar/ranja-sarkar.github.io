Structured Query Language or SQL allows interaction with a database by writing queries to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data stored in the database tables. It is basically the language to communicate with data. A relational database management system (RDBMS) uses SQL and its variants to access data from a database. One can use SQL to create, read, update, and delete tables of data in RDB.

Examples of RDBMS:

1. [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/): It is an open-source RDBMS that is used for developing web applications, often accessed using PHP. It has been around since 1995 and has a large community. 

2. [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/sql-server/): It is a server-based RDBMS from Microsoft, typically used as a backend for applications running on a network. 
   
3. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): It is an open-source RDBMS that emphasizes extensibility and compliance to the ANSI SQL standards. Postgres is also typically used for wenApp development.

4. [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/): It stores a database in a single file (.db). One of the most significant advantages with SQLite is that all data can be stored locally without having to connect the database to a server. It works seamlessly with python.
