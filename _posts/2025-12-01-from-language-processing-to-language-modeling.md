If represented in a Venn diagram, the AI world underwent a change with the advent of generative AI (genAI). Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) remain major subsets in the AI superset. The deep learning (DL) set has genAI as a subset having substantial intersection with NLP.

One would ask, where is Data Science? 

Well, we humans create value with data and it is what we call Data Science that takes many forms. We start with a business problem and work toward an appropriate data-backed solution. AI is part of Data Science. 

Coming back to the Venn diagram, the [remaining space](https://open.substack.com/pub/ranjas/p/artificial-intelligence) in the AI superset would have transfer learning, reinforcement learning, hyperpersonalization.

With NLP, several tasks like topic classification, sentiment analysis, relationship extraction, and entity recognition can be accomplished. The input data for NLP can multimodal like  text, audio, video. I will write about text data here.
