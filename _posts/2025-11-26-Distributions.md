During my doctoral research, I had used the software Mathematica by Wolfram. My visits to the Wolfram Mathworld page gradually became rare events. 
I visited it recently and landed at their pages of [Probability and Statistics](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/ProbabilityandStatistics.html). 
And I couldn't help exclaim, 'how beautifully demonstrated!”

Maybe I was too distracted back then to have not noticed, or I was too much into partial differential equations (PDEs).

The French Mathematician, A. de Moivre developed 'normal distribution' as an approximation to [binomial distribution](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinomialDistribution.html). 

The [normal distribution](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalDistribution.html) becomes a 'standard normal distribution' of a variate with zero mean & unity variance.  
 
The ratio of two standard normal variates gets us a [Cauchy](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CauchyDistribution.html) variate.   
The square of a standard normal variate gets us a [Chi-squared](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Chi-SquaredDistribution.html) variate.  

The addition/sum of Chi-squared variates gets us a [gamma](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GammaDistribution.html) variate (another Chi-squared variate) and the ratio of two independent gamma variates gets us a beta variate.  
The beta distribution, for both shape parameters equal to unity that is, beta (1, 1) becomes a standard [uniform distribution](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/UniformDistribution.html).  

One can use [Box-Muller transformation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Box-MullerTransformation.html) on two independent standard uniform variates to arrive at two standard normal variates.  
 
I dug up the web deeper and found an [illustration](https://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/chart/UDR/UDR.html) of the relationships between distributions.

------

Uniform distribution, wherein outcomes are equally likely and standard normal distribution are **continuous probability distributions**. In the [latter](https://github.com/ranja-sarkar/ranja-sarkar.github.io/blob/bfff302d9d74c8e00c0557045ce44960d4c97d0d/_posts/assets/nd.png), mean, median, and mode of the distribution coincide. The curve of the distribution is bell-shaped and symmetrical about the line x=μ (mean). The total area under the curve is 1. 


Exponential (1-parameter) and Weibull (2-parameter) distributions are also continuous probability distributions. To know more about them, please refer to [the page](https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Equations%20of%20supported%20distributions.html) of reliability engineering.

Now, Bernoulli distribution for one is a **discrete probability distribution**, wherein a single trial has 2 possible outcomes.
