Missing values in tabular data occur when information is either not available or difficult to find. Grasping the underlying reasons of the absence of data and scrutinizing the nature of missingness are crucial. Often, understanding the data generating  mechanism becomes important. 

**Handling missing data** demands a nuanced approach, far beyond quick fixes. If a dataset contains a large percentage of missing values, their presence can be detrimental to statistical estimation. 

There exist missingness patterns viz.,

1. Missing completely at random (MCAR)

2. Missing at random (MAR)

3. Missing not at random (MNAR)
