Is writing important? Why do I write?

Well, before I started writing, there were loose ends of my concepts or there was knowledge that I thought I have; I often grappled with complex problems. After I started writing, there’s sort of an illumination and I felt like I’ve begun to know how to approach problem-solving, open-ended problems mostly. Writing has made me a better researcher, thinker, and scientist. 

As a scientist, I wrote papers to highlight the novelty of my research because they were meant to get published in acclaimed journals. It’s like writing about how I’m taking the scientific community forward with my research contribution. However, the writing style should not always be taken for granted for how a scientist thinks or speaks. 

Blogging is a more open act. It was not much earlier that I began doing it. I realized that keeping a blog is maintaining write-ups to acknowledge what I know or do not know and work through my confusion. And the fact that an open community of people can read your blog is like opening yourself up to feedback and criticism from all corners, not bounded by your reasearch area. It is designed to focus on learning, rather than novelty. Having published journal papers as a scientist, I could appreciate the whole idea of blogging.

At times, it is difficult to know what you must know when you have a lot to learn. Passive reading does not give me confidence, I can’t be sure if I knew what I knew. But writing things down is the best way I have figured that ensures I do the work, then explain it to others. This clearly is an active form of knowing and understanding.

Learning through writing is a longer process, yet it is worthwhile as you end up creating a permanent store of personalized knowledge which can be recalled later, consulted, and improved too as is the case. Almost all of us have clear understanding of a few things and cloudy concepts of many other things. The real contentment is in sharing your learning with others and learn back from them. Contributing to the community has two-way benefits, it is useful to more than just myself. 

Yes!  Writing is important - it not only makes you learn and understand, it helps you work through your confusion and build up confidence.

I am often asked by newbies with non-coding background about how to learn coding.

I have two answers to that. First, telling them NOT to resort to chatGPT or other conversational AI bots initially, after having learned coding one may use them as assistants. Second, telling them I do not exactly know the ONE path that would serve the purpose of every one. Why so?

Everyone’s learning journey is different. The coding language one wants to learn and pursue further in their careers might be different from the language I have known and can guide them with. Deciding how one wants to learn - formal training from an online/offline instructor or self-paced training shows the path.  

Then I tell them how I learned coding. I had started my journey with the language Fortran for credits in my Masters (degree). The course on Fortran began as a mandate, soon became an interest. 

Having learned one programming language thoroughly, I could afterward pick other languages fast. Two online platforms I had benefitted from are [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) (first of its kind, founded in 1998) and [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) which came much later in 2011. I followed the former while in academia (before 2017) for learning R and python, followed the latter after stepping into the corporate (since 2017) for SQL and advanced python. 

There is an online interactive [tutor](https://pythontutor.com/), a platform where you learn as you code. You can learn Java and JavaScript as well from the online tutor. 

You could also find an online [mentor](https://www.codementor.io/) (mostly an experienced developer) to guide you as you learn and move to advanced stages. 

Then there are platforms like [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and [hacker-rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) that let you practice coding and prepare you for coding interviews. These are at your disposal, all you need to do is start. Choose one path that fits your goal and just begin!
