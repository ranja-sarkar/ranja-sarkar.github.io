**Is writing important? Why do I write?**

Well, before I started writing, there were loose ends of my concepts, there was knowledge that I thought I have but often grappled with complex problems. After I started writing, there’s sort of an illumination and I felt like I’ve begun to know how to approach solving open-ended problems. Writing has made me a better thinker, researcher, and scientist. Or may I say, writing has made me realize how sloppy my thinking is. 

As a scientist, I wrote papers to highlight the novelty of my research because they were meant to get published in acclaimed journals. It is writing about how I’m taking the scientific community forward with my contribution. However, the writing style should not always be taken for granted for how a scientist thinks or speaks. 

Blogging on the other hand, is a more open act. It was not much earlier that I began writing blogs. I figured keeping a blog is about maintaining write-ups to acknowledge what I know or do not know and work through my confusion. And the fact that an open community of people can read your blog is actually opening yourself up to feedback and criticism from all corners, not bounded by your reasearch area. It is designed to focus on learning, rather than novelty. Having published journal papers as a scientist, I could well appreciate the whole idea of blogging.

At times, it is difficult to know what you must know when you have a lot to learn. Passive reading does not give me confidence, I cannot be sure if I knew what I knew. But writing things down is the best way to ensure I learn, do the work, then explain it to others. Writing clearly is an active form of learning, understanding, and building confidence. As [Terry Tao](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/write-down-what-youve-done/) said, there is deep purpose behind writing. ⤵️

Learning through writing may be a longer process, yet it is worthwhile as I end up creating a permanent store of personalized knowledge which can be recalled later, consulted, and improved too as is the case. Almost all of us have clear understanding of a few things and not-so-clear comprehension of many other things. The real contentment is in sharing learning with others and learn back from them. Contributing to the community thus has two-way benefits, it is useful to more than just myself. 

Yes! **Writing is important**. 

I write as it makes me learn and understand something deeply, it helps me work through my confusion and build my confidence.

I am often asked by keen people with non-coding background about how to learn **coding**. I have two answers to that.

![chen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f5d36d3-fe11-4081-8e48-fca27bd8eab8)

One, telling them to learn coding first and consult or take coding help from AI tools like chatGPT after having learnt to code. Two, telling them I do not exactly know that ONE path that must be followed, it all depends on the purpose. Why so? 

Everyone’s learning journey is different. The coding language one wants to learn and pursue as a career might be different from the language I have known and can guide them with. Deciding how one wants to learn like formal training from an instructor with tests or self-paced training from MOOCs shows the path suited for oneself.  

And ofcourse I tell them how I learned coding. I had started my journey with the language Fortran for credits in my Masters (degree). The course on Fortran began as a mandate, soon became my interest. Having learned one coding language thoroughly, I could afterward pick other languages fast. Two online platforms I had benefitted from are [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) (first of its kind, founded in 1998) and [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) which came much later in 2011. I followed the former while in academia (before 2017) for learning R & python, followed the latter after stepping into the corporate for SQL and advanced python. 

There is an online interactive [tutor](https://pythontutor.com/), a platform where you learn as you code. You can learn Java and JavaScript as well from *pythontutor*. You could also find an online [mentor](https://www.codementor.io/) who's mostly an experienced developer to guide you as you learn and move to advanced stages. Then there are platforms like [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and [hacker-rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) that let you practice coding and prepare you for technical interviews. These are at your disposal, all you need is to start. 

Choose one path that fits your goal, and begin! 

One may ask now, in this age of vibe-coding (thanks to LLMs) who would want to really learn coding?

The answer is - those who learned to code (before LLMs) will know how to instruct them in generating good quality code, and those who build software with total assistance from LLMs will be limited by what they can explain to them verbally or in writing. Knowledge of coding will remove this limitation. **Coding is important**.

*Learning to code is crucial to not being able to effectively code.*

There's this question too - **is writing as important as coding?**

Well, like [Eugene Yan](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/writing-and-coding/) said, "code is for machines, document is for people".

Writing becomes more important as we climb up the career ladder.
