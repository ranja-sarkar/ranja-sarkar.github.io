Is writing important? Why do I write?

Well, before I started writing, there were loose ends of my concepts or there was knowledge that I thought I have; I often grappled with complex problems. After I started writing, there’s sort of an illumination and I felt like I’ve begun to know how to approach problem-solving, open-ended problems mostly. Writing has made me a better researcher, thinker, and scientist. 

As a scientist, I wrote papers to highlight the novelty of my research because they were meant to get published in acclaimed journals. It’s like writing about how I’m taking the scientific community forward with my research contribution. However, the writing style should not always be taken for granted for how a scientist thinks or speaks. 

Blogging is a more open act. It was not much earlier that I began doing it. I realized that keeping a blog is maintaining write-ups to acknowledge what I know or do not know and work through my confusion. And the fact that an open community of people can read your blog is like opening yourself up to feedback and criticism from all corners, not bounded by your reasearch area. It is designed to focus on learning, rather than novelty. Having published journal papers as a scientist, I could appreciate the whole idea of blogging.

At times, it is difficult to know what you must know when you have a lot to learn. Passive reading does not give me confidence, I can’t be sure if I knew what I knew. But writing things down is the best way I have figured that ensures I do the work, then explain it to others. This clearly is an active form of knowing and understanding.

Learning through writing is a longer process, yet it is worthwhile as you end up creating a permanent store of personalized knowledge which can be recalled later, consulted, and improved too as is the case. Almost all of us have clear understanding of a few things and cloudy concepts of many other things. The real contentment is in sharing your learning with others and learn back from them. Contributing to the community has two-way benefits, it is useful to more than just myself. 

Yes!  Writing is important - it not only makes you learn and understand, it helps you work through your confusion and build up confidence.
