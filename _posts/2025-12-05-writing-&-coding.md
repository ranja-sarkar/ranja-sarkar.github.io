Is writing important? Why do I write?

Well, before I started writing, there were loose ends of my concepts or there was knowledge that I thought I have; I often grappled with complex problems. After I started writing, there’s sort of an illumination and I felt like I’ve begun to know how to approach problem-solving, open-ended problems mostly. Writing has made me a better researcher, thinker, and scientist.
