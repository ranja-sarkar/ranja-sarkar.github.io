In one of my previous [posts](https://ranja-sarkar.github.io/2025/11/28/know-how.html), I have highlighted data visualization and how it is essential. However, a single post is not enough to state how much data visualization is crucial from data exploration until after a model (trained with the data) is in production.

[Anscombe's quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) outlines the importamce of graphing data before analysing.

The quartet has four datasets, four identical descriptive statistics, yet four different distributions when plotted and visualized. It only reinstates how powerful exploratory data analysis by visualization is. A visual explanation is mightier than explaining data through statistics, implying the importance of looking at a [dataset graphically](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/specialty_plots/anscombe.html) and not only relying on its basic statistics.
