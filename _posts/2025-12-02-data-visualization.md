In one of my previous [posts](https://ranja-sarkar.github.io/2025/11/28/know-how.html), I have highlighted data visualization and how it is essential. However, a single post is not enough to state how much data visualization is crucial from data exploration until after a model (trained with the data) is in production.

[Anscombe's quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) outlines the importamce of graphing data before analysing.

The quartet has four datasets, four identical descriptive statistics, yet four different distributions when plotted and visualized. It only reinstates how powerful exploratory data analysis by visualization is. A visual explanation is mightier than explaining data through statistics, implying the importance of looking at a [dataset graphically](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/specialty_plots/anscombe.html) and not only relying on its basic statistics.

When it comes to visualizing data, less is more. Keeping only what is necessary in the visual helps not only the developer to understand what important information the data yields, but also the business or audience to draw meaning from the visual.

There are caveats to data visualization as well. A collection of such caveats is nicely captured by [Yan Holtz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html). Few of my favorites are "too many distributions in one chart", "annotate your chart", and the "Simpson paradox".
