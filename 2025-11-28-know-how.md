Let me start with an acronym - IID. IID means independent & identically distributed which implies a collection of random variables where each variable has a probability distribution same as others in the collection and all of them are mutually independent. 

The **law of large numbers** states that when this collection is large sample, the sample mean converges to the true mean if it exists. The law applies to the average obtained from a large number of repeated trials and claims that this average converges to the expected (or mean) value.
